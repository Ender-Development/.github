# Ender-Development

Welcome to our page! Ender-Development currently consists of:
- [MasterEnderman](https://github.com/MasterEnderman)
- [Klebestreifen](https://github.com/Klebestreifen)
- [roz](https://github.com/rozbrajaczpoziomow)

This organization was created in September 2020 so me and my friend could work on projects together. In September 2025 roz joined us to provide some much needed help with the amount of projects we accumulated over the time. Right now we mostly work on Minecraft mods, but we are open to other projects as well. Everything we do is open source, so feel free to check out our repositories!
